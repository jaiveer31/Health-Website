        How does this medication work? What will it do for me?
      </h2>

      <p>
        Insulin is a naturally occurring hormone made by the pancreas that helps
        our body use or store the glucose (sugar) it gets from food. For people
        with diabetes, either the pancreas does not make enough insulin to meet
        the body's requirements, or the body cannot properly use the insulin
        that is made. As a result, glucose cannot be used or stored properly and
        accumulates in the bloodstream. Insulin injected under the skin helps to
        <b>lower blood glucose levels.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many different types of insulin and they are absorbed at
        different rates and work for varying periods of time. Insulin aspart mix
        contains insulin aspart and insulin aspart protamine crystals.
        <b>Insulin aspart is a rapid-acting insulin.</b> It takes 10 to 15
        minutes to begin working after the injection, has its maximum effect
        between 60 and 180 minutes, and stops working after 3 to 5 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >Insulin aspart protamine crystals are absorbed more slowly than
          insulin aspart, lowering the blood glucose levels over a prolonged
          period of time.</b
        >
        When mixed together they start working within 10 to 20 minutes following
        injection, reach a maximum effect between 1 to 4 hours after injection
        and lasts up to 24 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >Your doctor may have suggested this medication for conditions other
          than those listed in these drug information articles.</b
        >
        As well, some forms of this medication may not be used for all of the
        conditions discussed here. If you have not discussed this with your
        doctor or are not sure why you are being given this medication, speak to
        your doctor.
        <b>Do not stop using this medication without consulting your doctor.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >Do not give this medication to anyone else, even if they have the
          same symptoms as you do.</b
        >
        It can be harmful for people to use this medication if their doctor has
        not prescribed it. Never share your pen with anyone else as you may
        transmit serious diseases.
      </p>

      <h2 >What form(s) does this medication come in?</h2>

      <p>
        Each&nbsp;mL of sterile, uniform, white suspension contains insulin
        aspart (B28 asp regular human insulin analogue; 30% insulin aspart and
        70% insulin aspart protamine crystals) 100 units.
        <i>Nonmedicinal ingredients:</i> glycerol, phenol, metacresol, zinc,
        disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate, sodium chloride, protamine
        sulfate, sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid, and water for injection.
      </p>

      <h2 >How should I use this medication?</h2>

      <p>
        <b
          >Your required dose of insulin depends on how much natural insulin
          your pancreas is producing and how well your body is able to use the
          insulin.</b
        >
        Your doctor or diabetes educator will determine the appropriate dose for
        you according to various lifestyle factors and the blood glucose values
        obtained while monitoring your blood glucose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your dose of insulin should be injected subcutaneously (under the skin)
        exactly as instructed by your doctor or diabetes educator. Do not inject
        insulin aspart mix into the vein and do not use insulin aspart mix in
        insulin infusion pumps. The dose of insulin is measured in international
        units (IU). Each&nbsp;mL of insulin contains 100&nbsp;IU. Insulin aspart
        mix is injected under the skin not more than 5 to 10 minutes before the
        start of a meal. There are many variations of insulin dosing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >Insulin aspart mix is a white suspension available in cartridges. It
          is used in a special device that looks like a pen. The mixture should
          be uniformly white and cloudy.</b
        >
        Do not use the insulin if you notice anything unusual in the appearance
        of the solution, such as a frosted appearance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many things can affect the dose of a medication that a person needs,
        such as body weight, other medical conditions, and other medications.
        <b
          >If your doctor has recommended a dose different from the ones listed
          here,</b
        >
        do not change the way that you are using the medication without
        consulting your doctor.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is very important that you use this medication exactly as prescribed
        by your doctor.
        <b
          >The timing of insulin with respect to your meals is crucial to
          keeping blood glucose under control and preventing unwanted side
          effects.</b
        >
        If you are not sure what to do after missing a dose, contact your doctor
        or pharmacist for advice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep unopened cartridges of insulin in the refrigerator until needed.
        They may be used until the expiry date on the label. Never allow insulin
        to freeze. Insulin that is currently in use may be kept at room
        temperature for no more than 28 days and then discarded. Insulin must
        not be exposed to extremely hot temperatures or to sunlight. Keep
        insulin out of reach of children.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do not dispose of medications in wastewater (e.g. down the sink or in
        the toilet) or in household garbage. Ask your pharmacist how to dispose
        of medications that are no longer needed or have expired.

      <h2 >
        Are there any other precautions or warnings for this medication?
      </h2>

      <p>
        <b
          >Before you begin using a medication, be sure to inform your doctor of
          any medical conditions or allergies you may have, any medications you
          are taking, whether you are pregnant or breast-feeding, and any other
          significant facts about your health. These factors may affect how you
          should use this medication.</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Allergic reactions:</b> If you notice signs of a serious allergic
        reaction (e.g., swelling of the face or throat, difficulty breathing,
        wheezing, or itchy skin rash), stop taking the medication and seek
        immediate medical attention. Reactions at the site of injection
        (redness, swelling, and itching) usually resolve within a few days or
        weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Appearance of insulin:</b> The contents of the vial of this insulin
        should be cloudy and white. Do not use the insulin if it looks lumpy or
        grainy, seems unusually thick, sticks to the bottle or vial, or appears
        discoloured. Do not use it if it contains crystals, if the bottle or
        vial looks frosted, or if the suspension remains clear after being
        rolled between your hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Changes at injection site:</b> Fatty tissue under the skin at the
        injection site may shrink or thicken if you inject yourself too often at
        the same site. To help avoid this effect, change the site with each
        injection. Talk to your doctor or diabetes educator if you notice your
        skin pitting or thickening at the injection site.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Changes in insulin requirements:</b> Many things can affect blood
        glucose levels and insulin requirements. These include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          certain medical conditions (e.g., infections, thyroid conditions, or
          liver or kidney disease)
        </li>
        <li>
          certain medications that increase or decrease blood glucose levels
        </li>
        <li>diet</li>
        <li>exercise</li>
        <li>illness</li>
        <li>injury</li>
        <li>stress</li>
        <li>surgery</li>
        <li>travelling over time zones</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It is important your doctor know your current health situation and any
        changes that may affect the amount of insulin you need. Blood glucose
        should be monitored regularly as recommended by your doctor or diabetes
        educator.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Diabetic identification:</b> It is important to either wear a
        bracelet (or necklace) or carry a card indicating you have diabetes and
        are taking insulin.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Family and friends:</b> Educate your family and friends about the
        signs and symptoms of <i>hypoglycemia</i> (low blood glucose). Keep a
        glucagon kit available and instruct them on its proper use in case you
        experience severe low blood glucose and you lose consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Low blood glucose (hypoglycemia):</b> Hypoglycemia may occur if too
        much insulin is used, if meals are missed, or if you exercise more than
        usual. Symptoms of mild to moderate hypoglycemia may occur suddenly and
        can include cold sweat, nervousness or shakiness, fast heartbeat,
        headache, hunger, confusion, lightheadedness, weakness, and numbness or
        tingling of the tongue, lips, or fingers. Mild to moderate hypoglycemia
        may be treated by eating foods or drinks that contain sugar. People
        taking insulin should always carry a quick source of sugar, such as hard
        candies, glucose tablets, juice, or regular soft drinks (not diet soft
        drinks).
      </p>
      <p>
        Signs of severe hypoglycemia can include disorientation, loss of
        consciousness, and seizures. People who are unable to take sugar by
        mouth or who are unconscious may require an injection of glucagon or
        treatment with intravenous (into the vein) glucose.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Pregnancy:</b> It is essential to maintain good blood glucose control
        throughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements usually decrease during the
        first trimester and increase during the second and third trimesters.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Breast-feeding:</b> Breast-feeding mothers may require adjustments in
        insulin dose or diet. It is not known if insulin aspart mix passes into
        breast milk. If you are a breast-feeding mother and are taking insulin
        aspart mix, it may affect your baby. Talk to your doctor about whether
        you should continue breast-feeding.
