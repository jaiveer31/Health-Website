and centralize it in a common platform.

Patients, doctors, hospitals, pharmacy will be able to access prescribed medications,
reports while being cost effective and all this will be just be one touch away.

and it will be limited for a short period of time.

Main motive of our team is to deliver a complete centralized healthcare solution to the user

The application basically takes general health info about the user and about
their health record and maintains it.
